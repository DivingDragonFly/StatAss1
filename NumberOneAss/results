Total Plant Cover:
Wilcox: data:  tpc_2017 and tpc_2016
V = 529.5, p-value = 0.9086
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0

Because the p-value is higher than 0,05 we accept the null hypothesis, there is no significant difference between the groups.

Vascular Plant Cover:
data:  vpc_2017 and vpc_2016
V = 790, p-value = 0.6856
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0

Because the p-value is higher than 0,05 we accept the null hypothesis, there is no significant difference between the groups.


Moss:
data:  moss_2017 and moss_2016
V = 473.5, p-value = 0.242
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0

Because the p-value is higher than 0,05 we accept the null hypothesis, there is no significant difference between the groups.
