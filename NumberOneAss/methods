Research hypotheses:
There’s a difference between the planting outcomes between years
There’s a difference for the bare substrate between years
There’s a difference for total plant cover between years
There’s a difference for vascular plant cover between years
There’s a difference for moss between years

Null hypotheses:
There’s no difference between the planting outcomes between years
There’s no difference for the bare substrate between years
There’s no difference for total plant cover between years
There’s no difference for vascular plant cover between years
There’s no difference for moss between years

Because we are measuring a sample from the same population in a different time frame we could do a paired t-test, 
if the assumptions are met. Unfortunately, all variables are not normally distributed. 
Because of this we need to do a Wilcoxon sign rank test instead to test for a difference in mean in 2016 and 2017. 
All tests were performed in R, with a significance level of 5%. In order to prepare the data for the Wilcoxon signed rank test 
we need to make sure both variables have the same length.
